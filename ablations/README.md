This directory includes code for additional paper experiments beyond the main benchmark results.

In ```T0_variants```, we include code for running aggregation over PromptSource P3 prompts. To run this, load the T0 model using manifest and you can launch via the script:

```bash
cd T0_variants
bash run.sh
```
